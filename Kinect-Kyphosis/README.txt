Using the Program:

Important keys to note: 
    1. S 
    2. C
    3. Space Bar 

1. Select three points along the spine: C7, T12/L1, S1 
    -> Note: the first point you place will be apper as a red dot, the second point will appear as a blue dot, 
        and the last point will appear as a green dot

2. Press 's' on the keyboard to begin data collection of these points
    -> The viewer will automatically freeze after a collection of 5 frames
    -> Press the Space Bar to clear the points and restart program 

3. Press 'c' at any point after pressing 's' to immediately get distance between C7 and S1 along with C7 and T12/L1  
    -> If the s is not pressed before calculating data, an error will appear, and the program will crash 
        -> to be fixed later, by displaying a better looking error message, and likely prompting to start collection

4. Close Program when finished

5. At any point, you may reset all points and values by pressing the space bar 

NOTE: Upon closing, if calculations were not already done the program will automtically output distance between points C7 and S1, 
along with C7 and T12/L1, along with providing the average depth of each selected points

After the distances are printed out, the kyphosis index will be displayed
